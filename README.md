The   research   paper   will   include   the   following:
Introduction-   Introduce   the   research   topic   and   discuss   why   it is   important. Also,   provide   an   outline   of the   structure   of the   paper.
Method- Your research   method will be ‘literature   review’   .   You   need   to   critically   analyse   existing   literature   on   your   selected   topic.   Explain what   sources   of   information,   what   analysis   and   evidence   you   used   to   answer   the   research   question.
Findings   and   Discussion-   What   have   you   found   out   about   the   research   topic?
Discuss   your   response   to   the   research   question, based   on   the   evidence   and   your   analysis   of the   evidence.   The   research   paper   is   expected   to   contain   evidence   of   reading   a   wide   range of academic literature   and that you   have   gained   an   ability   to   critically   analyse   and   integrate   information   rather   than   simply   reproducing information.
Conclusion-   Conclude the   paper with   a   summary   of findings.   Do not introduce   new   information   here.
